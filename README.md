## My learning note

I created this React app by following Le Wagon's lecture, it was started from Le Wagon [boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/react-boilerplate)

Following the lecture, I found the Font awesome icon didn't show as expect. After asking people and Google, here are the solutions for your reference.

- [Font Awesome React doc](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react)

- [React Icons doc](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

- [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZSxSjKmW_Y&ab_channel=D%27Coders)
